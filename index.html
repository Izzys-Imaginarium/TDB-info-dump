Darkwick is an educational facility managed by the Anomalous Investigation Institute. It is a renowned private academy, which has held the number-one ranking nationally for decades. Located on an artificial island in Tokyo Bay, entry by outsiders is strictly prohibited. The number of applicants who pass their top-secret entrance exam is a closely guarded secret, and it is rumored to be extremely competitive. Darkwick is famous for producing elites who play key roles on both the national and world stage.
Darkwick has a gothic-looking main building, grounds that stretch for miles and is surrounded by thick woods. Stone paths are lined with colorful flower beds along the lush grass. A glittering fountain stands in the center. The island is larger than it appears from the mainland, offering a unique and peaceful atmosphere. There are cats in hats emblazoned with the Darkwick insignia darting all around, with relaxed expressions and glossy coats.
The main building features a spacious hallway adorned with marble pillars, extending beneath an intricately decorated ceiling and a patterned carpet.
The counseling room is a comfortable lounge with warm wooden walls and a fireplace in the center.
The chancellor's office features a grand spiral staircase and an extravagant chandelier, creating an atmosphere of grandeur that deters unfamiliar visitors.
In the Galaxy Express, there is "lost property" floating high in the air. The train itself is a steam train with soft velvet seats and an old-fashioned vibe. The walls are wooden with antique lamps hanging from the ceiling, and the starry sky is visible from the windows.
Currently the academy has 7 houses: Frostheim, Vegastrom, Jabberwock, Sinostra, Hotarubi, Obscuary, and Mortkranken.
There used to be 3 other house, but they have been closed. They were called Dionysia, Ultio, and Clementia.
The Anomalous Investigation Institute is run by Jin's father. The Anomalous Investigation Institute has search and recovery personnel to help investigate cases and incidents after they conclude by gathering and cleaning up evidence.
The Frostheim dormitory is large and lavish in design with a ballroom and an aurora lit entrance. Although beautiful, the azure castle-like dormitory is enveloped in cold air.
Frostheim has the most influence out of the Darkwick houses, as the Frostheim captain, Jin Kamurai, is the son of Darkwick Academy's president. Furthermore, Professor Dante serves as the house's advisor.
Frostheim students value success and are self-confident and relentless in the pursuit of their goals. Most Frostheim students come from rich families and often engage in gossip and enjoy gloating about their wealth.
Vagastrom is shown to be a garage, smelling like tires and dust, and having graffiti everywhere. It is shown to be a very busy dormitory, as the MC describes “Metallic clangs grazed my ears, and periodic explosions of orange sparks lit up my field of view.” and then describes it as “intense”. Kaito has said that it was filled with motorbikes and cars. Furthermore, Professor Dante serves as the house's advisor. They have an underground ring called "the Pit" for fights. The Pit is located underneath the Vagastrom dormitory.
The residents of Vagastrom are shown to be “rude”, or “roguish”. The captain of Vagastrom, Alan Mido, was once rumored to have killed somebody, but nobody is brave enough to ask what happened. The students of Vagastrom don't seem to be on good terms with the students of Frostheim, perhaps due to an incident called "the Clash”. Despite this, the vice-captain of Frostheim, Tohma Ishibashi, was caught by Leo Kurosagi to be interacting with Alan, with Leo saying that they “meet up all the time”. Tohma explained that he wanted to keep the houses in good relations and as such, Tohma only reports to Alan when there is a major issue.
Jabberwock is shown to be a nature reserve for anomalous creatures. The weather is constantly changing, one minute it might be sunny, and the next, snow. It is also shown to be very large. Haru, the captain of Jabberwock, has converted it to a safari park to help pay for renovations, food for the animals, and general upkeep of the park.
Jabberwock has a mountain over 3000 meters high, a diverse forest, babbling brooks, and a cave system by the lake. Jabberwock has an aquatic area for aquatic and amphibious anomalous animals.
Haru recently purchased a "capybus" which looks like a giant capybara, but it has windows and can be ridden in by passengers. Haru uses this to run tours of the park.
Non-ghouls are no longer admitted into Jabberwock.
Sinostra students value challenge and are powerful and decisive. The Sinostra dorm is a luxury cruise ship that stands aground in a vast desert. Aside from housing students, the cruise ship also contains an academy-sanctioned casino. The Sinostra casino, which opened six months ago, is permitted by reason of contribution to student welfare and employs students from other Darkwick houses as floor staff. The casino is often filled with students and the tune of clinking coins and jazz.
The Hotarubi grounds are shown to resemble a traditional Japanese garden surrounded by trees blossoming in purple flowers. A Japanese-style house can be seen in the distance. It rains all-year round, the gentle sounds of rain accompanying the quiet air. The MC describes it as "rain-scented air tinged with an odd sense of melancholy" and remarks the place to be "pretty magical" and "wistful." It is also covered in thick mist that causes "many first-time visitors to find themselves lost upon entrance" according to Professor Moby, who serves as the house's advisor.
The interior is described to be beautiful, although it "is in sore need of a renovation" according to the vice-captain, Haku Kusanagi. The entrance to the captain's room is a sliding door, matching the traditional Japanese style of the dormitory. There is also a reception room, mainly purposed for serving tea and sweets for guests.
Deep inside the grounds, there lays a lake shore hidden in thick mist. Students can row across the lake in one of the small boat at the harbor. On the other side of the lake, there is a cave that has dimly lit and damp corridors. Along both sides of these corridors are cells, containing anomalies. According to the MC, the place almost resembles a prison. Behind a massive metal door is the sturdy cell Lyca Colt was previously imprisoned in. Throughout the story, it is implied multiple times that Lyca was badly mistreated and neglected during the two years he was confined in his cell. According to Haku, this form of imprisonment could happen to any of the ghouls inhabiting Darkwick if they don't cooperate or behave or are "deemed as a threat to humanity". It is later revealed that this cave/facility used to be managed by one of the lost house, Ultio, but is now being run by Darkwick to "keep anomalies deemed too dangerous for human contact."
The students of Hotarubi are known to be one of the finest in Darkwick Academy, holding a pristine reputation amongst students and professors alike. The residents are typically "busy with their own creative pursuits" and "rarely venture out without reason." Despite most of them being holed up in their rooms all day, they are shown to be very welcoming to guests and "seem to have a lot of respect for each other's time and space."
Hotarubi students mostly specialize in anomalies endemic to Japan, meaning they focus on anomalies that regularly appear in Japan. Although their slim field of expertise allows a relatively peaceful and calm school life, the captain, Subaru Kagami, states that it usually makes it harder for the residents of Hotarubi to leave significant academic marks.
The students of Obscuary are all considered "non-human". The Obscuary dorm is a spooky old house in an area of campus surrounded by a deep dark woods. Rui runs a bar inside the dorm and has fixed up several guest rooms for anyone that isn't able to make it home when the bar closes. Obscuary also has a large botanical garden with a wide variety of anomalous plants. Rui uses the plants to make drinks for his bar. Jiro has also been known to use plants from Obscuary's botanical garden for creating new medicines.
Obscuary only accept non-humans as there are no general students and even most ghouls aren't able to join. It's also said that students can't be assigned there by the Weighing of Souls. Though, Moby said otherwise when it put Lyca there.
Mortkranken is the seventh House in Darkwick Academy, where students studying anomalous medicine reside and also functions as a medical center in the academy. It is characterized by the presence of medical equipment, specimens, and facilities -resembling that of a laboratory.
Students in this house administer and conduct student health assessments. An example of this is the assessment performed on {user}, which appears to have been administered by vice-captain Jiro Kirisaki.
Mortkranken students deal explicitly with anomalous medicine and research. The only ghouls revealed to reside in this house are the captain and vice-captain. Aside from them, it seems that no new ghouls were assigned to the house in the past few years.
Darkwick academy offers a variety of classes including: Anomalous Medicine, Anomalous Combat, Anomalous Biology, Anomalous Law, and Anomalous Information Studies.
The Clementia dorm was in a church. It's now run down due to the dorm being closed. {user} lives in Clementia.
Darkwick students message and communicate through a cell phone app called WickChat.
Darkwick reports important information through talking portraits, the system is called Masterpiece News.
Students at Darkwick take on missions for their houses. General students take on low ranking missions. Ghouls take on more difficult or dangerous missions. The goal of most missions is to investigate anomalous events and in some cases to subdue, kill, and/or capture anomalies for research purposes.
When a case concludes the ghouls and Darkwick Anomalous Instiute employees use mesmer matches to erase the memories of any civilians involved in an anomalous event.
Darkwick offers a "special admission program" for ghouls. A ghoul is a person who made a pact or contract with a demon and their soul was not consumed by the demon. It is theorized that ghouls somehow consumed their demon and gained a special power called a stigma.
Every ghoul has a unique stigma. Most stigmas have a trigger word to activate them, although there are some ghouls who do not need to use a trigger word to activate their stigma.
